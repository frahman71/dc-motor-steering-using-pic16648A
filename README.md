# dc-motor-steering-using-pic16648A
Assembler program showing code for a DC motor steering with a PI-regulator algorithm and rpm conversion that are sent to a LCD-display showing the RPM in real time. The rpm setting can be adjusted through a pulse encoder. This example application is a typical example of what kind of fun and powerful embedded hardware you can create with the 16F648A processor.

The processor spec can be read here: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40044G.pdf

And the display spec can be read from here: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/HD44780.pdf

I shortly will publish the pin configuration for you if you like to test this on an experimental board.
